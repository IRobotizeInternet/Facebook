Software automation open source project of Facebook using [Advanced POM](https://github.com/IRobotizeInternet/AdvancedPOM)

After successfully develpoing and implementing software automation methodology to handle large-scale enterprise solution in many of our projects, we have decided to automate entire Facebook as an example and share new and improved ways of automating large projects.

The project is built using below technologies: 
* Selinium
* CSharp
* Javascript
* Powershell

However, the software design is more important here, you can implement it in any language you wish.

Please note the script written to share knowledge of advanced methods and techniques to design large-scale automation projects. Do not use this script for any kind of web scrapping or in a manner that violates Facebook policies.

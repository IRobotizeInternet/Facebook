# Facebook
One of the largest software automation open source project. #Facebook 
After successfully implementing automation to handle large-scale enterprise solution at my company, I have decided to automate entire Facebook as an example and share with you guys.
To develop this project, I have mostly used these technologies: 
* Selinium
* CSharp
* Javascript
* Powershell
* Python

However, the software design is more important here, we can implement it in any language. 
I will upload the software methodology soon on Youtube with explaination, please subscribe if you are interested. 

Please note the script written to share knowledge of advanced methods and techniques to design large-scale automation projects. Do not use this script for any kind of web scrapping
or in a manner that violates Facebook policies.
